## How to Run

To Run this program you'll need:

- Python 3 installed on your computer.
- The Tkinter module, a standard GUI library for Python. You can install it by running the command `pip install tkinter` in your terminal.

### Installation
You need to install the required packages from the requirements.txt file from above.
You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` .
You can run it in either way:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the folder where the repo is located and run the command:

    ```
    YoutubeVideoDownloader.py
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code from the `YoutubeVideoDownloader.py` file into your preferred code editor or IDE
3.  and you should also download the above 'Youtubelogo.png' file in the same directory. And you can run it from there.

Once you run the program, a window will pop up with a youtube logo and there will be the input field where you can paste a link of a video you want to download and download it.
