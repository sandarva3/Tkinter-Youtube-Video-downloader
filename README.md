# Youtube Video Downloader

This is a simple tkinter program which I created a back in the days, in which you can paste a link of a youtube video to download it.

## How to Run

To Run this program you'll need:

- Python 3 installed on your computer.
- The Tkinter module, a standard GUI library for Python. You can install it by running the command `pip install tkinter` in your terminal.

You can run it in either way:

1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the folder where the repo is located and run the command:

    ```
    YoutubeVideoDownloader.py
    ```

2. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the code from the `YoutubeVideoDownloader.py` file into your preferred code editor or IDE and run it from there.

Once you run the program, a window will pop up with a youtube logo and there will be the input field where you can paste a link of a video you want to download and download it.
